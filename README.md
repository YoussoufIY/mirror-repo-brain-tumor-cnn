# Project Outline 
Brain tumors are one of the most deadly and challenging diseases to diagnose and treat. The current methods of diagnosing brain tumors involve the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. However, analyzing these scans is time-consuming and requires expertise. Use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can help to analyze these scans in a faster and more accurate way to effectively identify individuals with brain tumors. 

# Objective 
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can detect brain tumors accurately using MRI images that can be uploaded onto a website. The model will be trained on a dataset of MRI images that have been labeled with either the presence or absence of a tumor. The model will then be able to classify new MRI images as either having a tumor or not.
